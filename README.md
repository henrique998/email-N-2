# Keycloak in the Gitpod

This repo is an minimal example for Keycloak 17+ Gitpod deployment (not for Keycloak legacy 17+).

Single click provisioning 
[![Gitpod ready-to-test](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--test-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jangaraj/keycloak-in-gitpod/) 
and you can test/work/develop with Keycloak in a minute.

Predefined Keycloak credentials are `admin/admin`. It is recommended to create
own realm, client and user(s) in that realm for the testing. 

See [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=govLwCN-fbQ) how to start
Keycloak in the Gitpod, create `myrealm` realm, create `myclient` client 
(client has many config options, so you will very likely need to customize it 
for your use case), `myuser` user and set password for `myuser`.
